# Trident HealthCare 

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npm install 
npx hardhat run scripts/00-deploy.js
npx hardhat run scripts/01-seeding.js
npm start
```
